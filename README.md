## Project Description

This project simulates and controls a robotic arm using **ROS2 Humble**, **Gazebo**, and **MoveIt2**. The robotic arm is defined using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) and is capable of executing planned trajectories within a simulated environment. The simulation integrates ROS2 control with MoveIt2 for advanced motion planning and trajectory execution. Additionally, the robotic arm is controlled using a camera and ArUco markers placed on the robot, workspace, and objects, enabling precise object pick and place operations through image processing and computer vision techniques.

## Features

- **Simulation Environment**: Realistic simulation using Gazebo.
- **Motion Planning**: Advanced trajectory planning with MoveIt2.
- **Control Mechanism**: Camera-based control using ArUco markers.
- **Object Manipulation**: Pick and place objects within the simulated workspace.
- **Camera Calibration**: Accurate camera setup for reliable image processing.
- **Modular Design**: Integration of Python and C++ for flexibility and performance.

## Setup

1. **Camera Calibration**

    Accurate camera calibration is essential for reliable image processing and marker detection.

    ```bash
    command for camera calibration that can be used to guide new contributers
    ```

    Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the calibration process and save the calibration parameters.

## Usage

### Launching the Simulation

Start the Gazebo simulation environment with the robotic arm.

```bash
ros2 launch robot_description gazebo.launch.py
```

### Controlling the Robotic Arm

The robotic arm is controlled using a camera that detects ArUco markers. Ensure the camera is calibrated and has a clear view of all markers.

```bash
ros2 run robot_control node_name # Check CMakeLists.txt for node's names identification
```

### Object Pick and Place

To perform object pick and place operations, use the provided Python and C++ scripts that interface with MoveIt2 for motion planning.

1. **Start MoveIt2**

    ```bash
    ros2 launch robot_moveit_config moveit_gazebo.launch.py
    ```

2. **Execute Pick Operation**

    ```bash
    # In progress
    ```

3. **Execute Place Operation**

    ```bash
    # In progress
    ```

### Image Processing

Image processing scripts handle the detection of ArUco markers and object recognition.

```bash
ros2 run robotic_control object_detector
```

## Architecture

The project is structured into several key components:

- **URDF Definition**: Defines the physical and visual properties of the robotic arm.
- **ROS2 Control**: Manages the hardware interfaces and controllers for joint movements.
- **MoveIt2 Integration**: Handles motion planning and trajectory execution.
- **Gazebo Simulation**: Provides a realistic environment for testing and development.
- **Camera and ArUco Markers**: Facilitates precise control and object tracking through computer vision.
- **Python and C++ Nodes**: Implements control logic, image processing, and communication between components.

## Technologies Used

- **ROS2 Humble**: Robot Operating System for middleware and communication.
- **Gazebo**: Simulation environment for robotics.
- **MoveIt2**: Motion planning framework.
- **URDF**: Robot description format.
- **Python**: Scripting and automation.
- **C++**: Performance-critical components.
- **OpenCV**: Image processing and computer vision.
- **ArUco**: Marker-based tracking.
